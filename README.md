# This is my random guessing game! 
This game was made using the ***random*** import in ***Python***. The game asks for the user to input a random number and stores it. The game then picks
a random number between 1 and whatever the user input was. The user is then asked to guess a random number between those parameters. The app keeps track 
of the number of user guesses and increments by one for every user input. At the end it gives you the total amount of tries it took you to get it right.
